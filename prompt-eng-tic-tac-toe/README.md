# Prompt Engineering Tic-tac-toe

## Description

Create a Tic Tac Toe Terminal game in Python by utilizing prompt engineering concepts 
 to generate a series of prompts that will allow you to accomplish this task.


Use this outline below as a guide to help you use targeted prompt engineering to get ChatGPT to generate code for a tic-tac-toe program. ChatGPT will try to generate all the code for the program in one go; please ignore that, and, use this exercise as a chance to practice your prompt engineering skills and build your tic-tac-toe program in pieces.

*Stretch goal: Use prompt engineering with ChatGPT to generate pytest tests.*
## Outline of program design and features

This is a rough guide - feel free to adjust and make it your own.

# Features:

# High-level features:
# - Human player turn
# - Computer player turn
# - Getting human player input
# - Printing the board for the human player to see
# - Check afer every move to see if:
#   - Someone one
#   - Cats game

# Computer AI, we can do player vs computer. We'd like it to be smart
# but we can start with it being dumb and simple.
# - Computer making its move
# - AI is --- random move

# User input:
# - User inputs their move for each turn:
#   - Maybe we do this by user inputting row and column for their move.
# - Ask the user if they want to be "x" or "o"

# Show the board with the current state of the game


# Flow of game
# - Who goes first? Player A
# - Player A makes their move
# - Now it's player B's turn, and player B makes their move
# - ... and so on ....

# Human Player
# - Need to be able to see the board
# - Prompt for their move
#   - We need tell the user how to enter their  move

# Computer Player
# - Randomly generates a move
# - Needs to know spots available, or, if randomly generated move is valid or not
